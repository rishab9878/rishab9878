I'm Rishab Sarayan, a passionate 2nd-year engineering student with a thirst for knowledge and a love for coding. I'm currently pursuing my Electronics and Communication Engineering degree, and I'm always eager to explore new technologies and apply them to exciting projects.

At this stage, my primary focus is on honing my skills in C Programming and learning CSS. I'm also exploring how technology can be leveraged to solve real-world challenges and make a positive impact on society.
